# GridStatus Portfolio

This is my attempt apply my python skills acquired through coursework and independent learning to the gridstatus api: https://github.com/kmax12/gridstatus

My analysis is a work in progress, however, it has allowed me to better understand how the grid works, grid metrics, and the effect clean energy proliferation has on it.
